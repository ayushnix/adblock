## Introduction

This repository contains personal adblock lists that I use in uBlock Origin.

If you're interested in using them, you can copy the following links and import them in uBO.

- [search engine cleaner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayushnix/adblock/master/filters/search.txt) list
- [annoyances](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayushnix/adblock/master/filters/annoyances.txt) list
- [youtube cleaner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayushnix/adblock/master/filters/youtube.txt) list

## Scope

The search engine cleaner list is meant to block SEO spam on search engines and other useless
websites that probably shouldn't exist. The annoyances list is meant to spam elements on web pages.
The youtube cleaner hides most youtube elements that are unnecessary and add no value.
